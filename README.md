# Epigenetics Algorithm

[![](https://img.shields.io/continuousphp/git-hub/doctrine/dbal/master.svg)](https://github.com/cuquiwi/epiGA)


## Contents
This project contains an implementation of the algorithm exposed in: [EpiGenetics](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0020025517309921) and a normal 
genetic algorithm for comparison porpuses. The implementations are both focused
in solving the TSP algorithm.


## Requirements
The code is written in python 3.6. and its requirements can be found in 
[Pipfile](https://github.com/cuquiwi/epiGA/blob/master/Pipfile). 


## Running the code
To run the code you only need to run inside of the folder `python .`.

There is an example [\__main__.py](https://github.com/cuquiwi/epiGA/blob/master/__main__.py)
which can be modified in order to run different experiments. In the folder [res](https://github.com/cuquiwi/epiGA/tree/master/res)
there is also a set of examples that can be used to show see how the algorithms perform.
